This algorithm reads a sentence and analyzes it character by character until it reaches the final point (.), which marks the end of the sentence. During the scan, it uses three counters: one to count the total number of characters, one to count the number of words, and one to count the number of vowels. The character counter increases for every character read (excluding the point). The word counter starts at 1 and increases each time a space is found, since words are separated by a single space. The vowel counter increases whenever the current character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u in uppercase or lowercase). At the end, the algorithm displays the total number of characters, words, and vowels in the sentence.
